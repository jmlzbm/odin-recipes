<h2>Lemon-olive oil tart</h2>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/3 cup sugar + 1/2 for the lemon curd</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 lemon, with grated zest + peel reserved</li>
    <li>1/3 cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups oat milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F or 180°C. Brush sides and bottom of tart pan with oil, then line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, add grated lemon zest, water, oil, and sugar. Mix well with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix with the same spatula until just combined. Compact the dough with your hands until it comes together, without working it much or kneading it.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough onto the tart pan and flatten it with the palm of your hands to cover bottom and sides.</li>
    <li>Trim excess dough, if any, then pierce bottom and sides with a fork.</li>
    <li>Bake the pie empty at 350°F or 180°C for 18-20 minutes or until slightly golden.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. To a sauce pan, off the heat, add milk, sugar, cornstarch, lemon peel (not the grated zest), and turmeric. Whisk until there are no lumps.</li>
    <li>Bring to a simmer on medium heat while whisking until the liquid becomes a thick and smooth custard. Turn heat off, add the lemon juice, and remove the lemon peel. Keep whisking for a minute.</li>
    <li>Fill the crust with the lemon curd and spread it evenly with a spoon. Bake for 5 more minutes at 350°F or 180°C, then take it out and let it cool down for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
